This project basically consists in implementing a variety of iterative methods for solving Lapace's equation. The main goal is to solve the potential flow over a bi-convex airfoil in a simple cartesian comptutational grid. The solution over the airfoil is obtained by imposing the small disturbances theory as boundary conditions in this region. The numerical scheme is a simple Finite Difference scheme.
